rust-mongo
==========

A library implementing the wire protocol for mongodb.

## Current Status

At the moment, only parts of the bson representation are working. I've had to go through a couple different iterations with different serialization libraries, so different parts are missing all over the place.

Next to come:

1. bson deserialization
2. mongo query
3. saying hi to david
